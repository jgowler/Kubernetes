# Kubernetes Overview  

Kubernetes is a **powerful container orchestration platform** that automates **deployment, scaling, and management** of containerized applications.  
Widely used in **cloud-native infrastructure**, it ensures efficient resource utilization and high availability.

## Features  
- **Automated Scaling** – Dynamically adjusts workloads based on demand  
- **Self-Healing** – Detects failures and automatically restarts affected components  
- **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks** – Enables seamless application updates  
- **Multi-Cloud & On-Premises Support** – Compatible across diverse environments  
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing** – Efficient traffic routing and distribution  

## Why Use Kubernetes?  
- **Efficient container management** – Simplifies orchestration for microservices  
- **High availability & resilience** – Monitors and recovers failing workloads  
- **Multi-cloud flexibility** – Runs across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more  
- **Declarative infrastructure** – Uses YAML for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- **Enterprise-grade security** – Supports RBAC, secrets management, and policy enforcement

## K3S: Lightweight Kubernetes  

**K3S** is a **lightweight Kubernetes distribution** designed for **edge computing, IoT devices, and small-scale clusters**.

### Key Differences Between K3S & Kubernetes  
- **Optimized for small systems** – Requires fewer resources  
- **Single binary package** – Simplifies installation with fewer dependencies  
- **Embedded SQLite** – Uses lightweight databases for control plane storage  
- **Lower RAM & CPU usage** – Ideal for resource-constrained environments  
- **Simplified management** – Reduces complexity for easier administration  

### Why Use K3S?  
- **Perfect for edge computing and IoT**  
- **Lower overhead compared to standard Kubernetes**  
- **Easy deployment on Raspberry Pi, ARM-based devices, or lightweight VMs**  
- **Built-in container runtime (Containerd) for efficient resource usage**  

K3S offers a **streamlined alternative** to Kubernetes while preserving essential orchestration capabilities, making it ideal for **lightweight deployments** and **edge applications**.
