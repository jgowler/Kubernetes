# ☸️ Kubernetes Overview  

A powerful **container orchestration platform** that automates **deployment, scaling, and management** of containerized applications.  
Kubernetes is widely used for **cloud-native infrastructure**, ensuring efficient resource utilization and high availability.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Automated Scaling:** Dynamically adjusts workloads based on demand  
- **Self-Healing:** Detects failures and restarts affected components  
- **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks:** Ensures smooth application updates  
- **Multi-Cloud & On-Premises Support:** Flexible deployment across different environments  
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing:** Efficient traffic management  

## 🔧 Why Use Kubernetes?  
✅ **Efficient Container Management** – Simplifies orchestration for microservices  
✅ **High Availability & Resilience** – Monitors and recovers failing workloads  
✅ **Multi-Cloud Flexibility** – Works across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more  
✅ **Declarative Infrastructure** – Infrastructure as code using YAML configuration  
✅ **Enterprise-Grade Security** – Built-in RBAC, secrets management, and policy enforcement

## 🌿 K3S: Lightweight Kubernetes  

**K3S** is a **lightweight** Kubernetes distribution designed for **edge computing, IoT devices, and small-scale clusters**.  

### 🔄 How Is K3S Different from Kubernetes?  
- **Optimized for Small Systems** – Requires fewer resources  
- **Single Binary Package** – Simplifies installation with fewer dependencies  
- **Embedded SQLite** – Uses lightweight databases for control plane storage  
- **Lower RAM & CPU Usage** – Ideal for resource-constrained environments  
- **Simplified Management** – Reduces complexity for easier administration  

### ✅ Why Use K3S?  
- **Perfect for edge computing and IoT**  
- **Reduced overhead compared to standard Kubernetes**  
- **Easy deployment on Raspberry Pi, ARM-based devices, or lightweight VMs**  
- **Built-in container runtime (Containerd) for efficiency**  

K3S is a **streamlined alternative** to Kubernetes while retaining key orchestration features, making it an excellent choice for **lightweight deployments** and **edge applications**.
