Kubernetes - Self hosted Wordpress site with MySql DB

This project is designed to test my own skills of self-hosting a website, from purchasing the domain all the way through to storing the website data using MySql and a persistant storage.
The idea is to have a reliable website which would be more robust, with the ability to retain and restore data through pod deletions.

Once completed, this website will provide a guide through my process and how it came to exists, with tips and tricks I discovered along the way.
